This code contain the following:
An async function iterateWithAsyncAwait that takes an array of values and logs each value with a delay of 1 second between logs.
An async function awaitCall that simulates fetching data from an API. Use await to wait for the API response and then log the data.
An awaitCall function to handle errors gracefully. If the API call fails, catch the error and log a user-friendly error message.
A function chainedAsyncFunctions that calls three separate async functions sequentially. Each function should log a message after a delay of 1 second. Chain these functions using await.
